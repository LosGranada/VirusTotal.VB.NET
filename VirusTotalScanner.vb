''' <summary>
''' Other than removing the URL functions and converting the IEnumerable code to utilize a 
''' List(Of T) instead, the following classes and enums are pretty much a direct port of the 
''' example code provided by Genbox, which can be found at:
'''     https://github.com/Genbox/VirusTotal.NET
''' Also, as you can probably tell, I'm not really big on documentation, but the code is simple
''' enough that you should be able to to understand it with little trouble. :)
